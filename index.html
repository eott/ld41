                <h1>Manual</h1>
                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal is to transform the entire playing field into your
                    territory while removing any enemy influence from it. To do
                    this you build constructions that spread your influence or
                    attack the enemy territory. These constructions cost resources
                    which you build up by moving in synchronization with the beat.
                </p>
                <h2>Input</h2>
                <p>
                    You move over the playing field with the W-A-S-D keys or the
                    arrow keys. As the tiles are hexagons, moving to the right or
                    left will not result in a completely horizontal line, but
                    you will stay within the "lane" of hexagons.
                    With the spacebar you can construct buildings if conditions
                    are met. See section Buildings for details.
                </p>
                <h2>GUI</h2>
                <p>
                    In the lower part of the screen you have a simple GUI to help
                    you get an overview of the beat, the resources and the overall
                    situation.
                    <br><br>
                    The long line with the moving bars on it represents a moving timeline
                    of the beat. A beat happens just as a line passes the center of
                    the circle, which itself briefly flashes when this happens.
                    <br><br>
                    The light purple bar on the lower left denotes your synchronization
                    level. If you move with the beat it goes up; if you don't it goes
                    down with every movement off-beat.<br>
                    The white line in the bar is the building cost. If the bar reaches it,
                    you can construct or upgrade a building.
                    <br><br>
                    In the lower right there is a bar that shows the overall influence on
                    the playing field. The further into the green part the bar is, the
                    more influence you have.
                </p>
                <h2>Buildings</h2>
                <p>
                    Each faction starts with three starting buildings in the corners. You
                    cannot construct or upgrade these, but they will help you establish
                    influence over a small part of the playing field.<br><br>
                    If you are standing on a transformed tile of your factions (it will
                    have a green outline and look different than the neutral middle) and
                    have enough synchronization, you can hit the spacebar for
                    construction/uprading.<br><br>
                    An empty tile will turn into a tower, which raises your influence around
                    the tower and spread it further into neutral territory.<br>
                    A tower will turn into a power tower, which does the same but spreads
                    twice as fast.<br>
                    A power tower will turn into a thrower. Throwers don't generate influence
                    by themselves, but will attack the enemy territory at random.
                    The influence on any tile they hit will be raised or lowered to the
                    benefit of the faction the thrower belongs to.
